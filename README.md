# shunting-yard-algorithm
Expression parser that uses classical shunting yard algorithm first implemented by Dijkstra. Parses expressions and evaluates them. 
Supported tokens:
* simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation)
* trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent)
* logarithms (ln, log10)
* constants(pi, e)

Numbers should be entered with "." as a decimal separator (1.5).
Whitespaces are allowed - they will be automatically deleted by the program.
No variables are supported at the moment. Planning to include variables support.
