Expression parser that uses classical shunting yard algorithm first implemented by Dijkstra. Parses expressions and evaluates them. 
Supported tokens:
* simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation)
* trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent)
* logarithms (ln, log10)
* constants(pi, e)
